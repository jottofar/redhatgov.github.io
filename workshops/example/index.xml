      <description>Future Work One of the goals of this example workshop is to showcase all of the things that are possible when building a workshop. Initially, some work needs to be done to highlight what&#39;s already available. It&#39;s also expected that additional features will be added over time.
This &amp;quot;lab&amp;quot; is a place to collect those ideas so that we don&#39;t forget to update this workshop as we have time.</description>

      <description>Don&#39;t Recreate The Wheel Not only is this example workshop here to show you what&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s also expected to be the starting point and reference for any new workshop.
The easiest way to get started is to copy this workshop into a new directory and add your own content.
 Warning: There are a few things you&#39;ll need to change though, so pay close attention to each step below to save yourself frustration down the road.</description>

      <description>Getting Started This entire site, including the workshop content, is built using a tool named Hugo. Hugo is known as a &amp;quot;static site generator&amp;quot; where the content you build is pre-compiled before being served by a web server.
The Good News The good news is that you don&#39;t have to worry about how Hugo works, how to configure it, or how everything gets deployed.
All of that is being handled for you and you can focus on the content of your workshop.</description>
