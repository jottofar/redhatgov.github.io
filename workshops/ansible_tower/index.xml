      <title>Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands</title>

      <description>Section 1: Ad-hoc commands For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.
 Step 0: Define your inventory. Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run commands or your playbook(s).</description>

      <title>Exercise 1.1 - Writing Your First playbook</title>

      <description>Now that you&amp;#8217;ve gotten a sense of how ansible works, we are going to write our first ansible playbook. The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran and put them into a repeatable set of plays and tasks.
 A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or multiple tasks. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts.</description>

      <description>Section 1: Running the Playbook We are now going to run you&amp;#8217;re brand spankin&#39; new playbook on your two web nodes. To do this, you are going to use the ansible-playbook command.
 Step 1: From your playbook directory ( ~/apache_basic ), run your playbook.
 ansible-playbook --private-key=~/.ssh/workshopname-tower -i ../hosts install_apache.yml   However, before you go ahead and run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.</description>

  Each student will have two instances to use.
   Tower https://workshopname.tower.0.redhatgov.io:8888/wetty/ssh/ec2-user    Node 1 http://workshopname.0.redhatgov.io     Each of you should have received an email. It has the following information on it.
   If you didn&amp;#8217;t get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the information about your lab environment.</description>

      <description>That wraps up what we have planned for today. We hope you&amp;#8217;ve learned something valuable
about Ansible and Ansible Tower that you can apply in your daily role.
 What do you think? How can we help you understand Ansible Tower better?
 Before you leave, check out the Resources page that is part of this guide. There you can
find a ton of links that will further your Ansible education.</description>
